- ⚡ Fun fact: Some Machine learning models can be creative on their own! How? Models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) that have been used to create original art, music, and even entire pieces of literature.These models generate new content by learning the patterns and structures in existing data, but they often come up with surprising and innovative outputs. It's like teaching a machine to have a creative "spark" of its own!
